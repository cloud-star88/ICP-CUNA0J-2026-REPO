**Project:** Simple Application
**Description:** Implement core logic and data structures.
**Tech Stack:** Core Language
**Hints:** Focus on clean syntax

# Week 2 Documentation – Backend Application

## Step 1: Understanding the Project Goal
The goal of Week 2 was to implement **core programming concepts** by building a simple backend application.  
The focus was on logic, data structures, and clean syntax — not UI, databases, or deployment.

---

## Step 2: Choosing the Application
I chose to build a **task management backend application** (To-Do logic) because it naturally demonstrates:
- Data storage
- Control flow
- User input handling
- Backend logic

The application runs in the terminal.

---

## Step 3: Selecting the Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
I chose Python because of its clean syntax and suitability for demonstrating core concepts clearly.

---

## Step 4: Setting Up the Project Structure
I created a Week 2 project folder and added:
- `todo.py` → main backend logic
- `README.md` → project overview
- `documentation.md` → detailed process documentation

---

## Step 5: Defining the Data Structure
I initialized an empty list to store tasks:
- The list holds all tasks while the application is running
- No database is used
- Data is stored in memory only

This keeps the project focused on fundamentals.

---

## Step 6: Building the Menu Logic
I implemented a menu function to display available actions:
1. Add task  
2. View tasks  
3. Remove task  
4. Exit  

This menu guides user interaction with the backend logic.

---

## Step 7: Implementing Add Task Functionality
I wrote a function that:
- Prompts the user for a task
- Appends the task to the list
- Confirms successful addition

This demonstrates user input handling and list operations.

---

## Step 8: Implementing View Tasks Functionality
I implemented logic to:
- Check if the task list is empty
- Display a message if no tasks exist
- Loop through tasks and display them with numbering

This demonstrates conditional statements and loops.

---

## Step 9: Implementing Remove Task Functionality
I implemented task removal by:
- Displaying existing tasks
- Asking the user for a task number
- Removing the selected task from the list

Basic error handling was added to manage invalid inputs.

---

## Step 10: Controlling Program Flow
I used a continuous loop to keep the application running until the user chooses to exit.  
This ensures the backend application remains active and responsive.

---

## Step 11: Handling Errors
I added simple error handling to prevent the program from crashing when:
- Non-numeric input is entered
- An invalid task number is selected

---

## Step 12: Testing the Application
I manually tested all features:
- Adding tasks
- Viewing tasks
- Removing tasks
- Exiting the application

I fixed issues related to menu flow and input handling.

---

## Step 13: Final Review
I reviewed the code to ensure:
- Clean and readable syntax
- Proper function separation
- Logical flow

No extra features were added to keep the project aligned with Week 2 objectives.

---

## Conclusion
This Week 2 project strengthened my understanding of **backend logic**, **data structures**, and **core programming fundamentals**.  
It serves as a solid foundation for more advanced backend, DevOps, and cloud-based projects in future weeks.
