# Week 4 Project – Application Optimization

## Description
This project focuses on optimizing an existing Python To-Do application by improving its performance, security, and readability.

Rather than adding new features, the goal was to refine the internal structure of the application and apply better software engineering practices.

---

## Objectives
- Improve code readability and maintainability
- Reduce reliance on global state
- Add proper input validation and error handling
- Refactor functions to follow single-responsibility principles

---

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Basic profiling and code analysis
- Refactoring techniques

---

## Optimization Approach
The project followed a structured optimization process:
1. Reviewed the original application
2. Identified performance, security, and readability issues
3. Refactored code to remove global variables
4. Improved user input validation
5. Simplified control flow and function responsibilities
6. Added comments to clarify important logic

---

## Key Improvements
- Explicitly passed data between functions instead of using global variables
- Prevented empty or invalid user input
- Improved error handling for task removal
- Refactored functions for clarity and maintainability

---

## What I Learned
- Optimization is not only about speed but also clarity and safety
- Clean code is easier to maintain and scale
- Small refactors can significantly improve code quality
- Writing readable code is a critical engineering skill

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to analyze existing code, identify improvement areas, and refactor applications to meet professional standards.
