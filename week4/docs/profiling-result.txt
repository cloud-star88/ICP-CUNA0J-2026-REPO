PROFILING RESULTS – WEEK 4 OPTIMIZATION

Application: Python To-Do App
Objective: Identify performance, security, and readability improvement areas

--------------------------------------------------

1. GLOBAL STATE USAGE
Observation:
- The application relied on a global `tasks` list shared across multiple functions.

Impact:
- Makes data flow harder to track.
- Reduces predictability as the application grows.
- Increases risk of unintended side effects.

Optimization Decision:
- Remove global state and pass the task list explicitly to functions.

--------------------------------------------------

2. FUNCTION EXECUTION PATTERNS
Observation:
- Core functions (`add_task`, `view_tasks`, `remove_task`) are executed frequently within the main loop.
- `remove_task()` always calls `view_tasks()`, even when no tasks exist.

Impact:
- Unnecessary function calls.
- Reduced clarity in control flow.

Optimization Decision:
- Add early checks to prevent unnecessary execution.
- Improve conditional logic before function calls.

--------------------------------------------------

3. USER INPUT HANDLING
Observation:
- User input was accepted directly without validation.
- Empty tasks could be added.
- Invalid menu and task number inputs relied on exception handling.

Impact:
- Potential runtime errors.
- Poor user experience.
- Increased risk of unexpected behavior.

Optimization Decision:
- Add input validation for empty strings.
- Explicitly check numeric input ranges.
- Improve error messages for clarity.

--------------------------------------------------

4. READABILITY AND MAINTAINABILITY
Observation:
- Functions relied on shared state rather than explicit inputs.
- Some functions handled multiple responsibilities.
- Limited comments explaining intent.

Impact:
- Harder to understand and maintain.
- Difficult to test or extend.

Optimization Decision:
- Refactor functions to follow single-responsibility principles.
- Improve naming consistency.
- Add comments to explain key logic.

--------------------------------------------------

5. PERFORMANCE SUMMARY
Observation:
- No significant computational bottlenecks due to application size.
- Optimization focus shifted from execution speed to structural efficiency.

Conclusion:
- Performance improvements were achieved through better structure,
  reduced unnecessary execution, and clearer data flow rather than raw speed gains.

--------------------------------------------------

FINAL NOTE
This profiling process guided refactoring decisions and ensured
that optimizations improved code quality, safety, and maintainability
without altering application functionality.
