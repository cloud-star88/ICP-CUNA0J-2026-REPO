# Hello World Proof of Concept
**Objective:** Confirm environment setup and tool functionality  

**Script file:** `week1/02-hello-world/hello-world.sh`  
**Output:** Stored in `hello-world-output.txt` with screenshot evidence in `screenshot.png`

## Implementation
A Bash script was created to print a simple message - hello world. This demonstrates that the environment is functional and scripts can be executed successfully.

# Onboarding summary
Week 1 included orientation and initial guidance on repository organization, submission standards, and documentation practices.  
**Key takeaway:** building a strong foundation and documenting every step is essential for DevOps workflows.
